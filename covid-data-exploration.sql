Understanding COVID-19 Patterns Using SQL

What This Project Demonstrates:
- Combining datasets using SQL Joins
- Simplifying queries with Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Organizing data with Temporary Tables
- Using Window Functions for running totals
- Aggregating information to draw meaningful conclusions
- Creating reusable SQL Views for visualization
- Handling and transforming data types

-- Query 1: Where do we begin? ü§î
-- Let‚Äôs start by looking at rows where the continent is specified. This gives us a clearer picture to work with.
SELECT *

-- Query 2: A quick overview üåç
-- What‚Äôs in our dataset? Let‚Äôs grab some essential columns to understand cases, deaths, and populations at a glance.
SELECT location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population

-- Query 3: How deadly is COVID-19? üíÄ
-- What would be the death rate for people who contract COVID-19? Let‚Äôs calculate using the total cases and deaths.

-- Hmm, let‚Äôs figure out how much of the population was infected. What percentage does it add up to? ü§î

-- Let‚Äôs sum up the cases and deaths worldwide. Also, what‚Äôs the overall death rate? Let‚Äôs calculate.
